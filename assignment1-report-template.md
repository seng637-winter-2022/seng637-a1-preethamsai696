# Introduction

Automated Teller Machine will be controlled by the software, from which the ATM will recognize the card by the stripe reader present on the card. This project will include testing the software that is used to control the ATM. By using the ATM certain transactions can be performed which include deposit, withdrawal, balance enquiry and transfer of money between the accounts. Simply, it acts as a contact between the user and the bank server. When we insert the card, it will ask for the PIN and it will allow the customer to perform desired transactions after verification is done by the bank validation system. If the inserted PIN is wrong, it will ask to re-enter the Personnel Identification Number (PIN) and based on the consecutive steps the system will either proceed further or will retain the card if he/she enters the incorrect PIN a couple of times. 

Furthermore, the ATM Machine displays different transaction types to choose from based on the accounts that are linked to the card. Based on our requirement we must choose the required option. Since, ATM’s play a decisive role in performing different transaction types, it is very important to be sure about the software associated with them. The main aim of this project is to rigorously test the software developed and find the bugs associated with it. There are a few standard testing methods that can be performed on the software applications to find out the bugs and report them accordingly. The testing methods used in this project include exploratory testing, manual testing, and regression testing.

**Exploratory Testing**

Exploratory testing is a type of software testing where we focus mainly on simultaneous learning, test design and execution. It primarily focuses on the discovery and relies on the guidance of the individual tester to uncover defects that are not easily covered in the space of other tests. Exploratory testing is an unorganized kind of testing where we don’t follow any order for performing the test cases.

**Manual Testing**

Manual testing is the type of software testing where we can test the test cases manually without any automated tools. By performing manual testing, we can find out bugs, issues, and defects in the software application. Manual testing is a primitive technique where we can find critical bugs in the software. Any application should be manually tested to be automated. Manual testing requires more effort compared to automated testing. Manual testing doesn’t require any knowledge of any testing tools. Testing checks the quality of the system and delivers the bug-free product to the customer.

There are different types in manual testing which include:

1.	Black box testing
2.	White-box testing
3.	Unit testing
4.	System testing
5.	Integration Testing
6.	Acceptance Testing

**Regression Testing**

Regression testing is a powerful testing practice that ensures to run the application as per the prediction after bug fixes that have been detected before. This testing type is mainly responsible for running the application with stability and at its full functionality. To make developments and integrate changes in the applications, developed applications or software’s must go through multiple tests. Regression testing is the final step before delivering the application.

After doing new modifications to the code, this testing is responsible to ensure that the system stays sustainable under continuous improvements. These modifications might include bug fixes such as defects. This code mainly targets the bugs that were previously present in the version code before bug fixes, so that the updated code remains operational after new changes.
