# Introduction

Automated Teller Machine will be controlled by the software, from which the ATM will recognize the card by the stripe reader present on the card. This project will include testing the software that is used to control the ATM. By using the ATM certain transactions can be performed which include deposit, withdrawal, balance enquiry and transfer of money between the accounts. Simply, it acts as a contact between the user and the bank server. When we insert the card, it will ask for the PIN and it will allow the customer to perform desired transactions after verification is done by the bank validation system. If the inserted PIN is wrong, it will ask to re-enter the Personnel Identification Number (PIN) and based on the consecutive steps the system will either proceed further or will retain the card if he/she enters the incorrect PIN a couple of times. 

Furthermore, the ATM Machine displays different transaction types to choose from based on the accounts that are linked to the card. Based on our requirement we must choose the required option. Since, ATM’s play a decisive role in performing different transaction types, it is very important to be sure about the software associated with them. The main aim of this project is to rigorously test the software developed and find the bugs associated with it. There are a few standard testing methods that can be performed on the software applications to find out the bugs and report them accordingly. The testing methods used in this project include exploratory testing, manual testing, and regression testing.

**Exploratory Testing**

Exploratory testing is a type of software testing wherein we focus mainly on simultaneous learning, test design and execution. It primarily focuses on the discovery and relies on the guidance of the individual tester to uncover defects that are not easily covered in the space of other tests. Exploratory testing is an unorganized kind of testing where we don’t follow any order for performing the test cases.
